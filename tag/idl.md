The Interactive Data Language!

Outside of the astronomy, astro-, and geo-physics related communities, you are not likely
to have heard about IDL...  But like C or Fortran, if you take an internship at NASA, you're 
likely to see a bunch of this code!  It's bascially a competitor to MatLab, and has been owned and sold by many
more companies than I can keep track of.
