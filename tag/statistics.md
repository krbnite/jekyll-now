How fine should a classificatoins' resolutions be:  should a post be tagged with "statistics", or does
"statistical modeling" better describe it?  What if I'm thinking "general linear models" one day?  

I think "statistics" should be good enough.  There is also a "data science" tag if you need to add some
extra "oomph" to it.  I mean, there is also "machine-learning", right?!
