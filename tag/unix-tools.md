The tag is "unix-tools", but feel free to put/find specific Linux tools here as well.  Things like wget, curl, expect,
grep, sed, and awk...  Some of those things could have their own tag, but I generally think "unix-tools" is the
right level of resolution for this classification given the number of articles I have about individual tools.
