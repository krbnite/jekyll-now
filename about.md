### More Information
I have over a decade of experience analyzing and visually exploring data sets
from a diverse range of instruments on board multiple spacecraft
missions in Earth's ionosphere, magnetosphere, and in interplanetary space
(e.g., the [Van Allen Probes](https://www.nasa.gov/van-allen-probes), 
the [Advanced Composition Explorer](http://www.srl.caltech.edu/ACE/) (ACE),
the [Defense Meteorological Satellite Program](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/defense-meteorological-satellite-program-dmsp-space-weather-sensors) (DMSP), 
and [Voyager 2](http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/)) 
and from networks of ground-based instrumentation (e.g., the [U.S. Manned and
Automated Geophysical Observatories](http://www.sienageospace.dreamhosters.com/) (AGOs) 
in Antarctica and the
[International Real-time Magnetic Observatory Network](http://www.intermagnet.org/) (INTERMAGNET) with
instruments distributed across the globe).  I have used these
measurements to understand how to forecast and nowcast important
magnetospheric state variables, generate and test hypotheses, and
compare with simulations and predictive models.
