title: Wearables Weekly (W1)

A lot of my job is working with wearables in one way or another: wearing them, reading about them, 
using their data.  Sometimes I can lose sight of what's going on though while I get lost in the 
particulars of a specific project, or the mundanities of the work week.  So, in an attempt to
keep current, I present to you (me) -- Wearables Weekly.

I suspect a lot of this will be along the lines of "Google this," "Apple that."  Once upon
a time, I'd put Fitbit at the front of that list, but [Google bought Fitbit this past month!](https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20943318/google-fitbit-acquisition-fitness-tracker-announcement) However,
importantly, this is to keep an eye on other big players in the game, such as Samsung, Facebook, Sony,
and Microsoft, as well as more esoteric players focused on robotic surgery, fashion, and so on.  

In that spirit, a [Nov 18th article](https://www.medicaldevice-network.com/comment/top-tech-healthcare-wearables/)
lists the top tech companies for healthcare wearables as:
* Apple
* Facebook
* Fitbit 
* Garmin
* Google (Alphabet)
* HTC
* Huawei
* Microsoft
* Qualcomm
* Samsung
* Sony
* Vuzix
* Xiaomi

Not on this list, but also on my radar include:
* IBM
* Medtronics
* GE
* Philips
* Siemens
* Roche


## Apple
Apple is obviously a big player in the wristwatch space with its [Apple Watch](https://www.apple.com/watch/), but it is also a dominant force
in the [hearables market](http://industrynewsreleases.com/39874/global-hearables-market-growth-2019-2025-apple-samsung-sennheiser-sony-gnsivantos-starkey-bragi-doppler-miracle-ear/),
which is the buzzword for devices like Apple's [AirPods](https://www.apple.com/airpods/), which serve as traditional headphones, yet go beyond
with capabilities such as heart rate tracking, brain wave monitoring, and hearing enhancement.  They are also working
on some [smart glasses](https://www.tomsguide.com/news/apple-glasses) called -- drum roll, please -- Apple Glasses.

## Facebook
Facebook has [Occulus](https://www.oculus.com/?locale=en_US), which puts Facebook in the landscape of VR headsets.  This
technology could likely be repurposed for smart glasses as well, though the headset itself is definitely not such a
thing as is.  Facebook has also supported research looking into tactile communication -- that is, using vibrations
on a device, such as a wristwatch, to transmit messages (e.g., "Hi honey, when will you be home for dinner?!").  You
can learn more about that stuff in some of their published research:

* 2018: Zhao et al: [Coding Tactile Symbols for Phonemic Communication](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3173966)

## Google
As for Fitbit, we'll just jump straight into Google/Alphabet.  First things first: Google is clearly in the 
smartwatch/wristwatch space having acquired [Fitbit](https://www.fitbit.com/home), but they were actually
already in this space with [Verily](https://verily.com/).  Also, there has been talk about Google's Pixel
Watch for a long time, but no release -- at least, not in name.  There is a whole line of [smart watches](https://wearos.google.com/#find-your-watch) running
[Wear OS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wear_OS).  [Apparently](https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/18/20872740/google-pixel-smartwatch-flagship-why-it-failed-wear-os), 
Google did not think the watches were quality enough to braned them as "Pixel Watches," but that Wear OS was good enough
to release in LG products.  People never stoppped talking about Pixel though:  will it come about through their
their work with Verily, or will a "Pixel Watch" now come about through ownership of Fitbit?  Who knows: point is,
they are definitely in the watch space.  They also have dipped into the glasses universe a while back with
[Google Glass](https://www.google.com/glass/start/).  Importantly, one of Google's smarter moves parallels releasing the
Android OS for smart phones -- an OS for wearables, mentioned above, called Wear OS.  Of course, Apple has
[watchOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WatchOS), but that parallels iOS: Apple for Apple's sake.  As with 
Android, its Google's Wear OS that is being adopted by 3rd party manufacturers.

# Extra Credit:  EHR Companies
I heard about these guys at the Ai4 Healthcare conference.  They are actually EHR companies, but 
wearables taking the stage in healthcare means that any EHR company is also in the business
of getting a grip on wearables (standardization, etc).

## Cerner
Here are some articles from their
website focused on wearables:

* https://www.cerner.com/blog/wearable-devices-improving-clinical-outcomes

## Epic
Short and sweet: Epic owns 50% of the EHR market.  Seems like there are rumors that they could partner with Apple, or
be acquried by Apple...

## Allscripts
There are rumors about Epic and Apple, but actual dealings between Allscripts and Apple:
