title: Data Modeling with Graphs

In a previous post, we used the mighty pen (remember: fuck pencils) and rock-crushing paper to model
data using entity relationship diagrams (ERDs).  Today, we will use a pencil... Just kidding: today, we
will use the pen-and-paper approach to model our data with graphs.  Importantly, we will discuss how
to translate between ERD and graph models.
