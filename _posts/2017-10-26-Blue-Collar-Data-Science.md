Automation: it's what I do best.  

From webscraping and API calls, to statistical analyses, report generation, and automated emails: a
large part of being a data scientist is all about automation. Of course the role varies company to company, 
but I've found many other data scientists to discuss similar issues (e.g., "80% of my time is spent cleaning data!"). 

## But what about the fancy stuff?
Yes, there are also the fancy-sounding things that data scientists get to work on and apply, 
like machine learning models, deep neural networks, recommendation systems, and so on. These things
get all the press in magazine articles and newspapers (if and where those things exist).  But, from
a project perspective, that stuff is like that last mile in a marathon!

## The dirty stuff
It often seems to me that the uglier parts of a data-centric job
are glossed over by the unlimited numbers of online courses and schools dedicated to data science and/or
machine learning.  People pay data collection, cleansing, and preprocessing some lip service, but little else.

That's one of the reasons I write these posts: in the data real world, your employer will expect SO MUCH MORE 
from you.
