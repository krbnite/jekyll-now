I've been watching through the video lectures of the "Deep Learning School 2016" playlist on Lex Fridman's YouTube
account.  While doing so, I found it useful to collect and collate all the references in each lecture (or as many
as I could distinguish and find).

# 6. Nuts and Bolts of Applying Deep Learning (Andrew Ng)
[Video Lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ka6a13S9I&list=PLrAXtmErZgOfMuxkACrYnD2fTgbzk2THW&index=7&t=0s)

Ng talks about a typical, decent ML workflow, but notes one can do a better job at error 
analysis (i.e., understanding how model bias and model variance are affecting your results).  

```
          *---------------------------------------------------------------*
          v                                                               |
[Training Error High?] ---YES---> [Bigger Model | Train Longer | New Model Architecture]
          |        ^
          NO        \_______
          |                 *------*
          V                         \
[Dev Set Error High?] ---YES---> [More Data | Regularization | New Model Architecture ]
          |
          NO
          |
          V
         DONE
```

He actually had the Dev Set change point back to the asking whether the dev set error was 
high, but I pointed it back to asking whether the training set error was high.  Makes more sense, especially
if you change the model architecture!

He showed you can do better than this work flow, and in fact it is here I learned a new trick.  Basically,
in addition to looking and training and dev errors, you should look at the combined set error.  Hopefully
this next graphic helps that make more sense:

```
Human Error Rate: 1%
Training Set Error: 10%        
Training-Dev Set Error:  10.1%
Dev Set Error: 10.1%
Test Set Error: 10.2%
```

* An intuitive sense of model bias is found by comparing the human error rate to the training
set error: here, we have large model bias.
* Model variance can be thought of as the difference in error rate between training and training-dev (or
  between training and dev, as is usually done).
* Ng shows Training/Dev mismatch as the difference between error on training-dev and dev...
* Finally, the difference between dev and test error is a sign of overfitting the dev set

I have to give some of this more thought... But anyway, this analysis then informs Ng's updated
ML workflow:

```
# NOTE: oftentimes, a change made anywhere in the workflow indicates to start back
#   at the beginning (especially if an architectural change is made).

          *---------------------------------------------------------------*
          v                                                               |
[Training Error High?] ---YES---> [Bigger Model | Train Longer | New Model Architecture]
          |        ^
          NO        \_______
          |                 *------*
          V                         \
[Train-Dev Set Error High?] ---YES---> [More Training Data | Regularization | New Model Architecture]
          |
          NO
          |
          V
[Dev Set Error High?] ---YES---> [More Training and Dev Data | Data Synthesis | New Model Architecture]
          |
          NO
          |
          V
[Test Set Error High?] ---YES---> [More Dev Data]
          |
          NO
          |
          V
         DONE
```

Ng finds that progress in an area can be rapidly made until the human error rate is 
surpassed, then things get tricky.  This is in part due to there being an upper bound on
error rate, called the optimal error rate (or Bayes rate) -- and the fact that humans are
actually pretty good at many of the tasks we try to automate with ML/DL (i.e., oftentimes, the human
error rate is already fairly close to the optimal rate).  Also, once you surpass the human
error rate you can run into some fundamental issues, e.g., are humans the ones labeling your data? 

Ng brings up a toy medical example where he lists the typical human error rate as 3%, the typical
doctor error rate as 1%, an expert doctor's error rate as 0.7%, and the error rate of 
a team of expert doctors as 0.5%.  The point is: which one should you consider the "human 
error rate" for this problem?  Or more importantly: what type of data should you be using?  Disregarding
data collection costs and complications, the answer should be obvious: you want to train your
model based on the team of expert doctors.  This is one way to improve model performance: identify
and/or insist upon high quality data.  


If you are looking to make rapdid progress
on something, Ng's advice is to identify an area in which ML/DL has not yet surpassed the human error
rate.  This need not be something entirely new: for example, in speech recognition certain accents are
in need of improvement. 

How to get good?  Simple: read a lot of papers, replicate results, and get comfortable with all the
dirty work.  In other words, get serious, set expectations consistent with reality, and put in the time!
