Just started working on a new-to-me TensorFlow-oriented project at work.  The project is
dusty, having been on the shelf for a year or so.  I'm also dusty having been working on
other, non-TF-y things for the past 6 months.  For the past few days, I've waded through
another man's Python code, editing, googling, and finally getting things to run -- and that's
when I signed onto LinkedIn and saw Andrew Ng's post about this new course.

Crazy timing, Ng!  Thank you.  TensorFlow has the habit of drastically changing
release to release.  For this project, I'm using an old version, but in general I want want to keep 
up with the latest version (the 15 deprecation warnings I'm currently getting are a great
motivator).  In general, I could definitely use a refresher -- so here we go!
