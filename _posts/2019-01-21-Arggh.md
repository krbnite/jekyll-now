This is just a "I'll thank me later" post.  

Basically, if you `brew install R` on MacOS Mojave and then want to install the tidyverse, then
you're in for a world of hurt... That is, unless you pay heed to the wisdom found here:

I talked with some coworkers who just installed R from CRAN, or whatever.  They said they had no issues... Gets me
wondering: why did I brew install it?  Or more importantly: after knowing they had no issues, why did I continue
googling about the brew version?  Am I leaving myself open for more pain by sticking with the Homebrew version?

This also reminded me that it sometimes feels like R is built on a house of cards -- one change in your 
environment, and suddenly something doesn't work.  Anyway, I'm sure some of that has to do with my own
ignorance :-p
