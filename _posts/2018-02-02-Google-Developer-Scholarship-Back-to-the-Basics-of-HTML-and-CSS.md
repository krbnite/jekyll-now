title: Google Developer Scholarship: Back to the Basics of HTML and CSS

I hack together HTML reports and HTML emails, but some parts of the web development class and
the intro-level JavaScript courses made me ask, "But do I really know WTF I'm doing?"  

Nope.

I'm glad that I was able to be honest with myself about this b/c I actually learned so much
about parts of HTML and CSS that I either forgot, or simply never knew about.
