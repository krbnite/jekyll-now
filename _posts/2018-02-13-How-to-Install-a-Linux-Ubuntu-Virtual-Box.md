What if you work on a Windows machine, but actively develop Python scripts that run on Linux Ubuntu?  Installing 
a Linux virtual machine on your computer might sound pretty good! However, this isn't my problem: I work on a
MacBook Pro and rarely have an issue switching scripts between the two OS's.  So my problem is that I don't have
a problem, but still think the idea of running a Linux Ubuntu virtual machine on a non-Linux Ubuntu computer is cool AF.

So do it anyway: problem solved!
