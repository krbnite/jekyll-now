The data we explore today (whatever day it is for you) is the [mushroom data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/mushroom/)
found at the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository.

The type of exploration, you ask?

Asking sentient trees what they know about poisonous mushrooms, of course.

In the process, maybe we will learn a thing or two about these 
[arboreal decision makers](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html#tree)
(and hopefully figure out whether or not we sould eat that mushroom).

Go ahead and check out my [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/krbnite/FungusAmongus/blob/master/Decision-Trees-in-Sklearn.ipynb)
for some code, some figures, and a plain ol' good time!
