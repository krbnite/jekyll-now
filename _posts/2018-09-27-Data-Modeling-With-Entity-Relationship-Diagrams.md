title: Data Modeling with Entity Relationship Diagrams
layout: post

There are a lot of options out there for software to design these diagrams in, and I'll get
to using MySQL Workbench in another post (or who knows: maybe at the end of this post).  But right
now, I want to emphasize the good ol' fashioned pen-and-paper approach (pen, b/c fuck pencils).

At work, we have wearable devices.  Each device has sensors.  Devices can be categorized
into classes -- wrist watches, chest straps, socks, and so on.  The same can be said for sensors: accelerometers,
magnetometers, gyroscopes, and more!  For example, a Fitbit Ionic is a wrist watch that has an accelerometer.  Each
sensor is associated with properties, such as sampling frequency, signal resolution, and dynamic range.  Sometimes 
the raw sensor data is accessible via an API.  Sometimes USB. Sometimes not at all.  Sometimes a composite data
stream is provided instead of, or in addition to, the raw data streams.  

A knowledge base like this can become quite complex, and we need a good knowledge map lest we get lost!  Entity
relationship diagrams (ERDs) are a way to do this.  What's nice is that, following a few simple rules, one
can use ERDs to construct fully functional, normalized databases.

To avoid going into too much work detail, let's take an example from a past life -- let's model the instrumentation
associated with the Automated Geophysical Observatories down in Antarctica.
