title: Hello World! (Want your own GitHub blog?)
---

Want to host your blog on GitHub? I got up and running by following this 
(how-to guide)[https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/]
from (SmashingMagazine)[https://www.smashingmagazine.com].

Here are the cliff notes:

1. Fork https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now, which is a GitHub blog starter kit.
2. Change the starter kit's repository name to krbnite.github.io, which lets GitHub know
   this is the repository you want to host your site in.
3. Get a local copy of your site: git clone https://github.com/krbnite/krbnite.github.io 
4. Edit the \_config.yaml (e.g., change website name, bio pic, etc)
5. Stage, commit, and push: git add \*; git commit \*; git push
6. Make first blog entry by editing the provided MarkDown file in \_posts/, and 
   referencing this 
   (MarkDown cheatsheet)[https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet],
   if your eyes start crossing funny. (To see my first blog entry, keep reading :-p)
7. Learn more about customizing the YAML options for your blog entries (e.g., how to use
   tags, categories, and more):
