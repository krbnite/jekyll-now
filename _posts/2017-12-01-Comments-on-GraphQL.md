At work, I'm been diving deep on everything and anything Facebook:
* What is the Open Graph Protocol?
* How do I use the Graph API?
* What data can we get from Facebook Insights or Analytics? 
* How about Audience Insights? Automated Insights? Facebook IQ?

The list goes on!

Today I touched on GraphQL.  Figured I'd take some notes and blogify them for future reference.
