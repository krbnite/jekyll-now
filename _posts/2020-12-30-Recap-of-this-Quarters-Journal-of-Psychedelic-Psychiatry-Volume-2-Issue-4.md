The first article in the [latest issue](https://www.journalofpsychedelicpsychiatry.org/2020articles)
of [The Journal of Psychedelic Psychiatry](https://www.journalofpsychedelicpsychiatry.org/)
is called "A  Critical  Review  Investigating  whether  there  are similarities in 
EEG band waves between Schizophrenic patients and participants given DMT or 
Ayahuasca Tea."

"Early  research  suggests," the abstract begins, "that  the  endogenous  neurobiological  chemical  
Dimethyltryptamine  (DMT)  may  be responsible for schizophrenic symptoms." This is another way of
saying, "People do not quite understand schizophrenia, but have guessed at its causes in the
past -- namely, one idea is that the way that the schizophrenic brain generates its own DMT 
is a bit haywire." It's also a great opener for foreshadowing one of two likely conclusions: that this
idea does or does not hold up against the data! 

Without reading the abstract any further, you can already 
guess at the study design by this very first sentence: "Somehow," you guess aloud, "the authors 
will compare and contrast schizophrenic brains (pre-loaded with endogenous DMT) with healthy brains 
under the influence of exogenously-sourced DMT (e.g., [extracted from some chacruna, mimosa hostilis, 
or yopo](https://www.entheonation.com/blog/dmt-containing-plants/))." That's a great guess,
Dear Reader! The abstract continues: "This article investigates EEG band waves between participants 
given Dimethyltryptamine (DMT) or Ayahuasca Tea and schizophrenic patients."

Comparing and contrasting brains sounds simple, but how exactly do you do it? You can't just induce
a psychotic episode in a schizophrenic patient, then cut their brain out and freeze it. Can't do 
that to the healthy folks ingesting DMT or ayahuasca either!

"Fair enough, Kevin. So how do we do it?"

Good question, Dear Reader. Well, just riffing here, but -- one thing we might do is use 
brain imaging technologies (e.g., an fMRI) to track neural activity and blood flow throughout 
the brain. But we'd need to do this right! The schizophrenic patients should be off their medication 
and suffering through an episode of psychosis so we can capture the effects of that endogenous
DMT (probably not a great mindset when holed up in the claustrophobic coffin that is an fMRI 
machine). Similarly, we would want to capture the effects of the exogenous DMT on the non-schizophrenic 
participants -- also not a great mindset to be in while locked inside an fMRI, but SCIENCE!

"Oh, cool -- this actually sounds like an interesting experiment. Is this what they did in
the paper?"

Err, well no. Just getting excited. Sorry! Let's get back to the paper.

"Ok, cool."

In the paper, they reviewed published EEG data from several studies that mostly looked
at the populations of interest separately. The author wanted to profile...

SOME UNFINISHED WRITING:

Specifically, they were interested
in 5 bands of brain wave: delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma.


So we're looking to determine whether distinct patterns or signatures exist in the EEG signals that
can be used to infer whether or not the brain is schizophrenic or a non-schizophrenic brain driven
by DMT. If such a pattern is found to exist, then this provides evidence that the schizophrenic 
brain is not necessarily driven by endogenous DMT. If no pattern is found to exist, then this lends
some credence to the idea that the schizophrenic brain is indeed driven by DMT. In either case, we
do not have a slam dunk.  For example, if a distinct signature does exist, the schizophrenic brain
might still be driven by endogenous DMT -- just differently than how exogenous DMT typically affects
the brain (e.g., different regions).  Or it could be an artifact from a small population sample. 
Similarly, the inability to detect a difference doesn't necessarily imply the schizophrenic brain
is analogous to a healthy brain influenced by consuming DMT.  

Anyway, I'm getting ahead of the article here.
