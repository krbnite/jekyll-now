To be as efficient as possible, just take a look at this cheet sheat to my cheat sheet:

```python
model = someModel()
model.fit(x_train, y_train)
mode.predict(x_new)
```

That's it!  You're done learning.  Time to go teach a machine!

Need to see that repeated for a bunch of different models?  Then check out my 
[Scikit Learn Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/krbnite/CheatSheets/blob/master/sklearn.md).
