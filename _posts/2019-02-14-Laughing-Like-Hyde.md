It's Valentine's Day.  I'm in a room filled with impatient, frustrated citizens awaiting
their civic fate: to be called for jury duty, or not?!

A couple years ago now, when I first began working at WWE I wanted to try out GitHub Pages and,
ultimately, organize in one place all my old blog content, worthy Google Group posts, and unpublished "notes to 
self" that lay scattered about my digital spaces (Gmail, old computers, dead trees).  I wanted to
get up and going with minimal friction.  This thing called "Jekyll" kept surfacing, and a GitHub user (Barry Clark) had
this really convenient "get started now" starter pack.  Great!

Ok, fast forward a few years and I've developed some wants... For example, how can I quickly look at all
the Facebook Graph article I wrote while working at WWE?  Well, that should be pretty simple, right? Just
use tags, RIGHT?!

Wrong, buddy. ...uht!  Getting called for duty... BRB.
