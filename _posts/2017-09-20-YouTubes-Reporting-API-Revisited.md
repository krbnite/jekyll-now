For some motivation and preliminary reading, you might find my 
[original exploratory post](https://krbnite.github.io/The-YouTube-Reporting-API/)
on YouTube's Reporting API helpful.  In this particular post, I just want to cover some additional
technical details that I'm more aware of after having covered 
[Google's Client API](https://krbnite.github.io/The-Google-Client-API-for-Python/) and
[YouTube's Data API](https://krbnite.github.io/The-YouTube-Data-API/).
