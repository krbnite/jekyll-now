[Introduction and Overview](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/probabilistic-graphical-models/welcome-7ri4Z)

* a model is a declarative representation of our understanding of the world
* probilistic represents uncertain, noisy, and/or partial knowledge of the world
  - probabilistic models provide declarative representation w/ clear semantics
  - powerful reasoning patterns (conditioning, stratifying, decision making)
  - established learning patterns
* graphical: computer science representation of complex system

Two main classes of PGM:
* Bayesian Network: directed graph that represents a joint probability distribution, where 
  random variables are represented by nodes in the graph and edges represent the probabilistic connections 
  between the RVs
* Markov Model: undirected graph where nodes are RVs
  - example: image segmentation
  
The graphical representation provides an intuitive and compact data structure that supports
general-purpose algorithms for efficient reasoning.

Applications include:
* medical diagnosis
* image segmentation
* robot path planning
* textual information extraction
* multi-sensor integration (data fusion)
* biological network reconstruction

Inference = reasoning...
