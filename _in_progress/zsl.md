Connection with recommendation engines:

Combo of human and machine intelligence:

After the first paper I read about ZSL, my immediate reaction was: "This is beautiful: it combines classical
engineering approaches with machine learning -- instead of just relying on one or the other."  The above quote
explains ZSL as just that.

-------------------------------------------

Can't (easily) get access to the license plate data they used...  So I found a few I might use

* [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)
  - this is the standard dataset used all the time
* [The Chars74K dataset](http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/CVSSP/demos/chars74k/)
  - this is a "characters out in the wild" data set, so is more advanced than I want for a first project
