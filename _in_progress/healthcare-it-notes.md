Is a doctor going to kill you or save your life?

Great question.  Even the topnotch doctors can kill with bad penmanship!  This is no joke: it is just one
of the inefficiencies in healthcare that has driven policymakers to incentivise the healthcare profession
to utilize electronic healthcare systems.

Ever see a doctor chicken peck at a computer keyboard, muttering about 
this stupid technology stuff?  Did it make you feel safe?  No, probably not -- in fact, a survey has shown that
technology is associated with perceived quality of care even more than actual quality.

I learned about these things and more watching through the videos found in Mount Sanai's course,
[Health Care IT: Challenges and Opportunities](https://www.coursera.org/learn/healthcare-it), which I watched
in my ongoing effort to immerse myself in the culture and milieu of fields related to biotech, digital
health, and medical technologies.

Here's another tidbit: What are some determining factors for a patient's choice in healthcare provider?  Turns
out that people find location of healtcare to be important, which is no big surprise.  But it was also found that
healthcare consumers really dig email -- specifically, the ability to email one's symptoms to a doctor.  

Go figure, right?  Healthcare consumers like email?  Next thing you're gonna tell me they like text messaging...  Who
are these crazy healthcare consumers anyway?!  

That's basically what this course was about:  technology, or the apparent lackthereof, in today's healthcare experience.  In 
a way, we are all aware that our healthcare experience doesn't quite fit in with the rest of our tech-savvy lives -- and this
course will bring it all to the forefront.  

As 
one instructor put it when juxtaposing contrasting the current state with banking technology:  "I think this is what 
patients go through... [Patients] go to see one provider, and they provide all their information, and then they're referred 
to a specialist and they have to provide all the information again. And then they're referred for a procedure and they have 
to give the information again. At the same time, I can take the card that's in my wallet and go to the other side of 
this planet, put it in the machine, put in four digits, and get local currency instantly debited to my account 
within seconds."

The course instructors do generally think healtcare will get there:  "I think in five or ten years ... most of the care 
will be virtual... The healthcare will come to [the patients], wherever they are. Kind of picking the same analogy of 
banking, I don't have to go to a bank now to deposit a check. I can use an app, take a picture, and the money gets 
deposited. I think it's going to be very much the same in healthcare. We already seen the trend. And I believe in a 
couple of years we'll see telemedicine, secure messaging with doctors, kind of becoming main stream."

I'm going to let you in on a little secret: I've actually never emailed a doctor my symptoms.  Isn't that crazy?  Seems
like such an obvious and simple efficiency: instead of incoherently blathering on the spot, I could take some time to
craft an email, ensuring that I communicate all that I wanted to say.  This might be helpful to the doctor too, who can
come into the room with targeted questions.


## Patient Portals
Wouldn't be nice if your healthcare experience felt organized?  It definitely has felt piecemeal and unwieldy 
to me over the years: I have 
health records associated with no less than two urgent cares, a couple or so hospitals, and even a slew of primary care
physicians (took a few tries before one stuck).  Yes, you can get your records from each place and keep a folder
at home... But... 

I don't want to!  I can buy and sell stocks on my trading account from my mobile phone in the middle of 
nowhere, waiting for an Uber to pick me up and bring me to an AirBnB where I'll have some GrubHub delivered -- all
using Apple Pay.  I can view where that Uber is on a map as I wait and order that AirBnB 10 minutes before I 
arrive.  Each service will provide immediate email confirmation and status updates via text.  


You get the point.  I want to manage my healthcare experience in one place online.  I want to see a breakdown 
of charges, lab tests, and all past diagnoses in one place.  I want to pay my bills there, make an appointment, and 
view my data -- all of it: any X-rays, MRIs, ECGs, whatever.  Show it to me -- please!  For the love of love!

Some paranoid folks might think this is crazy, but we already do this with our bank accounts and credit cards.  It's
on about the same level of crazy as that.  

Definitely some health insurance providers have been doing ok at addressing some of this.  But as my provider
has changed when changing employers, I know mileage can vary quite a bit here.  

I also happen to go to a doctor and hosptial in the same healthcare network, which provides a patient portal.  This
seems to be going in the right direction: for example, I've been able to view some clinician notes and renew
prescriptions.  So that's cool.

### Questions I have about my patient portal
What features does my patient portal have?  How does that stack up against other patient portals?  Can I integrate 
patient portal w/ my iPhone?  Does it allow virtual/email visits?  Can I email symptoms?  How far back does my history go?  Can I integrate this EHR/portal w/ any others?

Does my portal:
* show breakdown of charges for each visit
* show paid/unpaid bills
* give an option to pay or contest bills
* provide ability to download my data in chosen format (CSV, JSON, whatever)
* have the ability to schedule an appointment
* provide cost estimates prior to care/service 
   - apparently controversial in US b/c of convoluted insurance arrangements w/ various institutions
* list accepted insurance providers
* list my allergies, meds
* allow me to transfer into another EHR system for other care, if necessary
* integrate w/ mobile or wearable devices

## Some reasons for lack of technology
What is the most crucial thing you need to communicate to a doctor -- and what if you cannot communicate it directly?  For
example, what if you have an allergy to a certain medicine that could kill you, but you are unconscious?

Simple bracelets have been best here.  Nothing fancy.

Can we do better?  Maybe...maybe not.  Ex: over a decade ago, an implantable chip never took off... Could be better, but could pose more risk than it's worth.
-- smart card (isn't it annoying to have to fill out paperwork every time you show up to a new clinic)
-- cloud solutions, e.g., MS HealthVault (RIP),  Google Health (also did not catch on) -- why did these technologies fail?  bracelet good enough! also, it was on patients to keep these things up to date... Google refused to partner w/ health institutions, and so their tech could not be a part of the HIPAA chain
-- EHRs and patient portals were incentivized by federal gov't starting in 2009, which ramped up interest in creating them well (and by this point, are considered...decent)

Imagine a recommendation engine using EHRs:  your various lab tests and biometrics are most like these other people, who have required surgery X -- ask your doc!  How about just seasonal notifications:  it's spring time, remember to take Zyrtec or you'll start feeling sluggish and weak again!  How about something simple like:  noticed Dr. X prescribed you medicine M and Dr. Y prescribed medicine N -- watch out, there are known interactions among these drugs.  Or that, but more personalized: although X and Y are safe together for most of the population, patients w/ EHRs similar to yours have higher propensity for negative side effects.  How about schedule a visit or send EHR access to another doc?  How about "info nuggets" about everything and anything: your meds, your bills, etc...  Recommended reading/videos/diet based on lab results, diagnoses, etc.

What is Google for Healthcare?  
I should be able to find any and all info about my lab tests, diagnoses, etc.  I should be able to ask reasonable questions, and get answers.
What is FB for Healthcare?
...
What is Netflix for Healthcare?
What is Uber for Healthcare?

Can I just sign on to my one app and request a video appt?  (You know, instead of looking up my insurance account, the special hotline or website, etc.  One app that syncs my insurance info, health info, etc, etc.)

There is some gatekeeping that goes on in healthcare, but ultimately -- when will an Uber step in?  Remember how revolutionary Uber was: hail a ride from your phone, get picked up in minutes, pay everything conveniently and electronically, get emailed a receipt, etc... Cabs had no idea what hit them in the face!   

How about when everyone thought Walmart and Barnes and Noble were the end of "Mom and Pop shops" -- only to be begging for mercy themselves as Amazon rose to prominence.

What is an AirBnB for healthcare?  Will a hospital be relevant in 10 years?

"I haven't met anybody below the age of 100 who doesn't like using a phone or a tablet to do Facetime with their grandkids or great grandkids. So it's not the technology."



Early Signal in a nutshell:
Sudipto Srivastava: "But as you look at what's happening, the noise that's out there, there's a lot of talk about devices that gather data. Gather data about your walking, what you're eating, you know how your blood pressure is doing. How different parameters of your whole body is doing. And right now, there's no real market to figure out. Well, what do you do with all that noise that it be generating? But I do believe that, as things get more sophisticated to analyze these data and more trends come out, we will be able to predict a lot more things much better. We can look at tell tale signs of certain disease conditions that maybe you know an indicator of an onset of something. And maybe hopefully, especially talking about the risk population intervene earlier and be able to do something about it."

Nick Genes: "I think you bring up a great point right now. I'm generating heart rate data and step counts and you don't have the capacity to share it with my doctor. Let alone, would I expect my doctor to be able to interpret that and give me useful feedback about how I'm exercising or sleeping or any number of things. But I think patients are going to start to expect that and healthcare systems should embrace that."

Digital medicine: leverage mobile tools that people use everyday (phones, tablets, watches)
- Challenge:  reimbursement is not aligned with mobile health (clinicians/nurses/etc do not necessarily get paid to do these new extras / nice-to-haves)
- Challenge:  so much of the core IT was developed pre-mobile, and adaptation has been slow


Mentions a cardiologist that said he prescribes more apps than drugs lately... What would it take to ensure apps are vetted and safe, just like the process for drugs?

What can an app help with:
* mindfulness of disease, symptoms, triggers, resposne
* adherence to medications, activities, exercise regimens (via reminders and measurements)
* monitoring - passive and "active" measurements, data collection, analysis
* communication with care team, improving coordination, answering questions

Pros/cons of apps from hospital perspective:
* as hospitals take on role of insurers, tracking adherence & disease progression becomes important for estimating risks, costs
* temptation to intervene, before flare-ups of chronic illness
* no savings or improved outcomes using tech/app-based management (so far)
* still, many insurers and hospitals investing  in apps for wellness anyway

The idea of "hospital as insurer" is interesting: at least superficially, you can imagine the hospital wanting to provide the best, most efficient care -- w/ minimal waste.  No longer would an MRI be prescribed because it helps increase profit margin, etc.... 

Apps from clinician perspective:
* quick-reference drug guides
* clinical calculators and scoring tools
* in resource-poor settings, smartphone can aid in most apsects of testing (vital signs, urine and serum laboratories, ultrasound imaging)
* assist in telemedicine, remote monitoring and data collection
* bedside decision making ("saved to the cloud" for record keeping)

https://nodehealth.org/

Features considered important by patients/consumers:
* health data export
* decision trees

UK reviews apps (has app store):  https://apps.beta.nhs.uk/

Recommends ResearchKit for making app prototypes for studies...and possibly to eventually turn into validated, verified medical app.
In asthma study/app, found that sicker individuals stuck with app for longer (which is opposite of having patients come into the office)....

Wearables... Detect disease before obvious symptoms arise (assess risk, allow for early intervention).  Prevent exacerbations of chronic conditions.  All the data: clearly cool.  But how does one intervene?  What exactly is the value of the data being collected, and how to train doctors, etc....  For every publicized success of something like the Apple Watch, how many people have falsely been panicked and driven to the doctor?  

Lead time bias:  "Emphasis on early detection presumes earlier interventions are more effective," however, early detection might simply mean "living longer since time-of-diagnosis (by definition)" since some disease might run "its own course, at its own pace, regardless of intervention."

Watch out for "technology that is looking for a problem."  Example given: temperature patches for infants.

Jawbone mapped out an earthquake's temporal and spatial fingerprint by noting a disruption in sleep amongst its users...

Health/dr kiosks at a store (e.g., Walgreens)... pretty cool.

Telemedicine reimbursement -- 2015 in NY (there now exist billing codes, etc);  billing codes for apps and wearables is something new too......

Though there are legitimate reasons how mobile phones and wearables can help healthcare, many doctors are cautious -- and for good reason: false positives, inexperienced determination, misinterpretation, misinformed usage, etc.  In a sense, easily accessible biometric, health-related data is not a panacea for healthcare.......... 

Why so many forms over and over?


An EHR system is basically like an OS...but not as useful or convenient... FHIR is probably more important than I originally thought: seems like medical software/tech needs serious paradigm shifts....

MUMPS -- revolutionary for its time... heirarchical database (these are what gave way to relational databases)... Nick joked that HIT often has "paved the way, then stayed there"

1970s:  Expert systems (e.g., MYCIN):  knowledge base consisting of 100's of rules; many questions to clinicians on patient parameters; answers determine therapy w/ reasonable degree of confidence;  worked really well for meningitis (better than the experts); .....but these things never really took off.

context-aware guidance

Is the patient a musician:  example about IBM Watson asking this concerning a certain drug, which causes hearing loss...patient might not want to take it!
