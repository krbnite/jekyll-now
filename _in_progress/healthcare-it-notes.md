Is a doctor going to kill you or save your life?

Great question.  Even the topnotch doctors can kill with bad penmanship!  This is no joke: "Doctors' sloppy 
handwriting kills more than 7,000 people annually. It's a shocking statistic, and, according to a July 2006 
report from the National Academies of Science's Institute of Medicine (IOM), preventable medication mistakes 
also injure more than 1.5 million Americans annually. Many such errors result from unclear abbreviations and 
dosage indications and illegible writing on some of the 3.2 billion prescriptions written in the U.S. 
every year. (2007: [Cause of Death: Sloppy Doctors](http://content.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1578074,00.html).)

I learned about these things and more watching through the videos found in Mount Sanai's course,
[Health Care IT: Challenges and Opportunities](https://www.coursera.org/learn/healthcare-it), which I watched
in my ongoing effort to immerse myself in the culture and milieu of fields related to biotech, digital
health, and medical technologies. In this post, I try to make a coherent narrative out of the scattershot
notes I took and thoughts I had while watching through the videos.  To ensure I wasn't just repeating gibberish, I 
often googled for references and extra reading -- and sprinkled 'em throughout this post.  

I take full credit for any horribly inaccurate nonsense or poorly-worded passages provided below.  

One last thing before we begin: I especially loved that Ross from Friends is one of the course's instructors 
(close your eyes and listen -- you'll know what I'm talking about).


## Inefficiencies in Healthcare
Fatal penmanship is just one
of the inefficiencies in healthcare that has driven policymakers to incentivise the use of
electronic healthcare systems (EHRs).  There are many more!

As anyone who has gone to their general practitioner who recommends an ENT who recommends a neurologist who recommends
a radiologist knows:  it annoying to have to fill out paperwork every time you show up to a new clinic.  Can't
you just swipe a card like you do at the ATM?  A "smart card" like this has already been tried, but never picked up. 

One instructor contrasted the current state of healthcare with that of banking:  Patients "go to see one provider, 
and they provide all their information, and then they're referred 
to a specialist and they have to provide all the information again. And then they're referred for a procedure and they have 
to give the information again." Importantly, it's not just that these inefficiencies exist, but they are anachornistic 
and incongruent with the rest of our tech-laden lives!  The instructor continues:  "At the same time, 
I can take the card that's in my wallet and go to the other side of 
this planet, put it in the machine, put in four digits, and get local currency instantly debited to my account 
within seconds."

The course instructors do generally think healtcare will get there:  "I think in five or ten years ... most of the care 
will be virtual... The healthcare will come to [the patients], wherever they are. Kind of picking the same analogy of 
banking, I don't have to go to a bank now to deposit a check. I can use an app, take a picture, and the money gets 
deposited. I think it's going to be very much the same in healthcare. We already seen the trend. And I believe in a 
couple of years we'll see telemedicine, secure messaging with doctors, kind of becoming main stream."



## The Optics Value of Technology Healthcare
Lack of technology inefficient.  It's anachronistic.  And aesthetically speaking, it's unattractive.

Ever see an older doctor chicken peck at a computer keyboard, muttering about 
this stupid technology stuff?  Did it make you feel safe?  No, probably not. You could be dealing
with the best doctor you'll ever meet, but still get the uneasy feeling that this guy is a dumb ass.

You wouldn't be alone: a survey has shown that
technology is associated with perceived quality of care even more than actual quality.

"Even when making a decision on where to go for less acute illnesses like the flu, consumers value the availability 
of cutting-edge technology. 71% of respondents prefer a clinic with cutting-edge technology to one with quality 
scores in the top 10% for their area." (2014: [Advisory Board: What Do Consumers Want from Primary Care?](https://www.advisory.com/Research/Market-Innovation-Center/expert-insights/2014/get-the-primary-care-consumer-choice-survey-results)

In another study, "virtually all patients report they are comfortable with their physician using technology during a consultation and 58 percent believe this technology positively impacts their overall patient experience especially when used collaboratively to educate or explain." (2015: HIT Consultant: [58% of Patients Feel Technology Improves Patient Experience](https://hitconsultant.net/2015/03/30/40-of-patients-feel-rushed-during-physician-appointments), which quotes
a 2013 study by the RAND Corporation -- [Factors Affecting Physician Professional Satisfaction and Their Implications for Patient Care, Health Systems, and Health Policy](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR439.html).)

The importance of "optics" here cannot be overstated: from the patient perspective, they outweight a doctor's credentials 
and a healthcare system's brand and reputation.  It may have no actual correlation with quality of care, but
it is a metric that will either be used for or against a healthcare provider.


## Basic Conveniences
When surveying for the determining factors of a patient's choice in healthcare provider, convenience trumps all. 
For example, the ability to walk in without an appointment and be seen in under 30 minutes ranked highest out of
56 attributes (2014: [Advisory Board: What Do Consumers Want from Primary Care?](https://www.advisory.com/Research/Market-Innovation-Center/expert-insights/2014/get-the-primary-care-consumer-choice-survey-results).  Walking in without an appointment and getting service is already quite a convenience, but
not convenient enough: raising that wait time to 60 minutes plummeted 38 spots in ranking.  Other conveniences include:
onsite imaging and lab tests, 24/7 hours, and proximity to home.  But none of this is a huge surprise.

The absolutely unimaginable, unearthly finding was that healthcare consumers find email convenient -- and thus, 
desirable. Specifically, patients -- people like you and me -- prefer radical healthcare providers that utilize
this bleeding edge technology (again, it's called "email") to replace or enhance appointments.  

Go figure, right?  Healthcare consumers like email?  Next thing you're gonna tell me they like text messaging, or easily
scheduling an appointment right from their phone. (They do.) Who are these crazy healthcare consumers anyway?!   

I'm going to let you in on a little secret: I've never emailed a doctor my symptoms.  Isn't that crazy?  Seems
like such an obvious and simple efficiency: instead of incoherently blathering on the spot, I could take some time to
craft an email, ensuring that I communicate all that I wanted to say.  This might be helpful to the doctor too, who can
come into the room with targeted questions.







## Mo' Tech, Mo' Problems
But with new technologies come new issues.



### Technology is Great (Except When it's Not)
A potential issue with using technologies, such as those associated with telemedicine, is that
the technology better be damn good -- like, ease-of-Netflix-or-Uber-level good.  It is 2019: people are generally
becoming more accepting of telemedicine technologies, but not of poor-quality ones!  In fact, a patient's perception
of the quality of care in this situation is hinged on the technology feeling fluid and easy, as is expected for
any web service these days (e.g., see: Donahue 2018: [How Penn Medicine looks at telehealth from the patient perspective](https://www.healthcareitnews.com/blog/how-penn-medicine-looks-telehealth-patient-perspective)).

### Bracelets
Some people do not have any critical information they must communicate to their healthcare providers.  Any
allergies to medication?  No.  On any medications?  No.  Any bizarre diseases?  No.  

For others, communicating before any treatment is perform can be crucial.  But what if they are unable to do so? Think: unconscious, in shock, or mental breakdown.  Should we all be chipped and scannable?

Over a decade ago, an implantable chip never took off... Sounded crazy then, and still sounds crazy now. Could pose more 
risk than it's worth.  

Fact is, simple bracelets have been best here.  Technology isn't always necessary.  Still, researcher and engineers 
tend to wonder: Can we do better?  In some areas of healthcare, we certainly can -- but it's been hard to gain 
traction.

### Clouds
Other instances of cold starts include various cloud solutions, such as MS HealthVault (RIP) and Google Health 
(RIP).  Why did these technologies fail?  The technology and convenience just didn't stack up to forgo classical
solutions like the bracelet!  For example, the burden of keeping these cloud accounts up to date fell strictly
on the patient.  Something like this could potentially be mitigated, but for example in Google Health's case, 
Google refused to partner with the appropriate health institutions, which meant that Google Health 
could not become a link in the HIPAA chain.


### Kiosks
Have you ever been to the supermarket and took a moment to take your blood pressure?  That is a simple 
healthcare kiosk.  Imagine if it could do other things, like leverage modern computer vision technologies 
to check your throat for strep, assess the probable cause of a rash or skin discoloration, and indicate
whether a mole is suspiciously cancerous looking.

A kiosk needn't be fully automated though: the diagnostic and prognostic care can come from a remotely 
located doctor, instead of an algorithm.  What's important is a "box" with sensors (camera, microphone, heart rate
detection, GSR, etc).  This type of enhanced "virtual visit" capability could be really
convenient.  Imagine going to CVS or Walgreens, getting a quick kiosk diagnosis, picking up your prescription
just outside the booth, then grabbing some comfort food and heading home for a bath!

But hey -- sometimes it's not even all that convenient to go to CVS. As cool as these things might be, seems 
like they've been money sinks for those who have tried to push 'em out. But not all
is lost: seems that there is a general sentiment that a healthcare kiosk has a definite niche, e.g., in a school,
private office, or in the ER.


> "Outside the healthcare setting, the kiosk’s main function is to replicate the visit to a doctor’s office, offering quick consults in a public setting such as a community center, jail, school, retail store, mall, office building or airport. Inside the pharmacy, hospital or clinic, they most often act as registration stations or patient education terminals. They can even be used as triage stations in an ED."

> "Large employer group customers see kiosks as a key part of their strategy to improve access to healthcare, manage costs and enhance productivity,” says John Jesser, Anthem Vice President and LiveHealth Online General Manager, whose telehealth service is integrated in American Well kiosks in more than 20 locations. “With a kiosk, depending on their health plan benefits, employees can see a doctor covered under their health plan without ever leaving the worksite, for a fraction of the cost involved in a worksite clinic."

### Synopsis
Technological and procedural innovation in this area has often been expensive and impotent: "Americans pay 
more and yet have serious access problems in primary care, long-term care, and much specialty care. Wait 
times to see all kinds of doctors are increasing in most areas of the country. To deal with this, in American primary 
care patients are guided into undifferentiated, highly transactional forms of service delivery that may be cheaper but 
are less comprehensive in the services offered and impersonal, involving fast-food care provided through web-based apps, 
big box stores, and urgent care centers. These sources of care often practice their medicine according to 'cookbooks' 
of standardized clinical guidelines using high-turnover providers, giving us fewer moments of the relational excellence 
so important in high-quality health care."  (Hoff 2018: [Seeing Value From the Patient’s Perspective](http://thehealthcareblog.com/blog/2018/04/30/seeing-value-more-from-the-patients-perspective/))






## Patient Portals
Wouldn't be nice if your healthcare experience felt organized?  It definitely has felt piecemeal and unwieldy 
to me over the years: I have 
health records associated with no less than two urgent cares, a couple or so hospitals, and even a slew of primary care
physicians (took a few tries before one stuck).  Yes, you can get your records from each place and keep a folder
at home... But... 

I don't want to!  I can buy and sell stocks on my trading account from my mobile phone in the middle of 
nowhere, waiting for an Uber to pick me up and bring me to an AirBnB where I'll have some GrubHub delivered -- all
using Apple Pay.  I can view where that Uber is on a map as I wait and order that AirBnB 10 minutes before I 
arrive.  Each service will provide immediate email confirmation and status updates via text.  


You get the point.  I want to manage my healthcare experience in one place online.  I want to see a breakdown 
of charges, lab tests, and all past diagnoses in one place.  I want to pay my bills there, make an appointment, and 
view my data -- all of it: any X-rays, MRIs, ECGs, whatever.  Show it to me -- please!  For the love of love!

Some paranoid folks might think this is crazy, but we already do this with our bank accounts and credit cards.  It's
on about the same level of crazy as that.  

Definitely some health insurance providers have been doing ok at addressing some of this.  But as my provider
has changed when changing employers, I know mileage can vary quite a bit here.  

I also happen to go to a doctor and hosptial in the same healthcare network, which provides a patient portal.  This
seems to be going in the right direction: for example, I've been able to view some clinician notes and renew
prescriptions.  So that's cool.

In general, some nice-to haves include: virtual/email visits, 
ability to email doctor current symptoms, exploration of my medical history as far back as I choose, integration 
of data from multiple patient portals (e.g., integration of a patient portal with iPhone Health app), 
easy-to-understand breakdown of charges for each office visit (or digital communication), overview of paid 
and unpaid bills, intuitive process for paying or contesting bills, provision of downloadable medical data
in chosen format (CSV, JSON, whatever), appointment scheduling, provision of cost estimates prior to care/service 
(apparently controversial in US b/c of convoluted insurance arrangements w/ various institutions), ability to 
sync consumer-grade bio/health data recorded from wearables and mobile appls (e.g., Fitbit, Apple Watch, sleep
apps, etc). 


# Imagination Time
Imagine a recommendation engine using EHRs:  your various lab tests and biometrics are most like these other people, who have required surgery X -- ask your doc!  

How about just seasonal notifications:  it's spring time, remember to take Zyrtec or you'll start feeling sluggish and weak again!  

How about something simple like:  noticed Dr. X prescribed you medicine M and Dr. Y prescribed medicine N -- watch out, there are known interactions among these drugs.  

Or that, but more personalized: although X and Y are safe together for most of the population, patients w/ EHRs similar to yours have higher propensity for negative side effects.  


How about schedule a visit or send EHR access to another doc?  

How about "info nuggets" about everything and anything: your meds, your bills, etc...  Recommended reading/videos/diet based on lab results, diagnoses, etc.

What is Google Search for Healthcare?  I should be able to find any and all info about my lab tests, diagnoses, etc.  I should be able to ask reasonable questions, and get answers.


Can I just sign on to my one app and request a video appt?  (You know, instead of looking up my insurance account, the special hotline or website, etc.  One app that syncs my insurance info, health info, etc, etc.)

There is some gatekeeping that goes on in healthcare, but ultimately -- when will an Uber step in?  Remember how revolutionary Uber was: hail a ride from your phone, get picked up in minutes, pay everything conveniently and electronically, get emailed a receipt, etc... Cabs had no idea what hit them in the face!   

How about when everyone thought Walmart and Barnes and Noble were the end of "Mom and Pop shops" -- only to be begging for mercy themselves as Amazon rose to prominence.

What is an AirBnB for healthcare?  Will a hospital be relevant in 10 years?

"I haven't met anybody below the age of 100 who doesn't like using a phone or a tablet to do Facetime with their grandkids or great grandkids. So it's not the technology."



Early Signal in a nutshell:
Sudipto Srivastava: "But as you look at what's happening, the noise that's out there, there's a lot of talk about devices that gather data. Gather data about your walking, what you're eating, ... how your blood pressure is doing. How different parameters of your whole body [are] doing... Well, what do you do with all that noise that it be generating? But I do believe that, as things get more sophisticated to analyze these data and more trends come out, we will be able to predict a lot more things much better. We can look at tell tale signs of certain disease conditions that maybe you know an indicator of an onset of something. And maybe hopefully, especially talking about the risk population intervene earlier and be able to do something about it."

Nick Genes: "I think you bring up a great point right now. I'm generating heart rate data and step counts and you don't have the capacity to share it with my doctor. Let alone, would I expect my doctor to be able to interpret that and give me useful feedback about how I'm exercising or sleeping or any number of things. But I think patients are going to start to expect that and healthcare systems should embrace that."

Digital medicine: leverage mobile tools that people use everyday (phones, tablets, watches)
- Challenge:  reimbursement is not aligned with mobile health (clinicians/nurses/etc do not necessarily get paid to do these new extras / nice-to-haves)
- Challenge:  so much of the core IT was developed pre-mobile, and adaptation has been slow


### Mobile Apps
Mentions a cardiologist that said he prescribes more apps than drugs lately... What would it take to ensure apps are vetted and safe, just like the process for drugs?

What can an app help with:
* mindfulness of disease, symptoms, triggers, resposne
* adherence to medications, activities, exercise regimens (via reminders and measurements)
* monitoring - passive and "active" measurements, data collection, analysis
* communication with care team, improving coordination, answering questions

Pros/cons of apps from hospital perspective:
* as hospitals take on role of insurers, tracking adherence & disease progression becomes important for estimating risks, costs
* temptation to intervene, before flare-ups of chronic illness
* no savings or improved outcomes using tech/app-based management (so far)
* still, many insurers and hospitals investing  in apps for wellness anyway

The idea of "hospital as insurer" is interesting: at least superficially, you can imagine the hospital wanting to provide the best, most efficient care -- w/ minimal waste.  No longer would an MRI be prescribed because it helps increase profit margin, etc.... 

Apps from clinician perspective:
* quick-reference drug guides
* clinical calculators and scoring tools
* in resource-poor settings, smartphone can aid in most apsects of testing (vital signs, urine and serum laboratories, ultrasound imaging)
* assist in telemedicine, remote monitoring and data collection
* bedside decision making ("saved to the cloud" for record keeping)

https://nodehealth.org/

Features considered important by patients/consumers:
* health data export
* decision trees

UK reviews apps (has app store):  https://apps.beta.nhs.uk/

Recommends ResearchKit for making app prototypes for studies...and possibly to eventually turn into validated, verified medical app.
In asthma study/app, found that sicker individuals stuck with app for longer (which is opposite of having patients come into the office)....
https://www.apple.com/researchkit/

Wearables... Detect disease before obvious symptoms arise (assess risk, allow for early intervention).  Prevent exacerbations of chronic conditions.  All the data: clearly cool.  But how does one intervene?  What exactly is the value of the data being collected, and how to train doctors, etc....  For every publicized success of something like the Apple Watch, how many people have falsely been panicked and driven to the doctor?  
* I have many references / reviews for this stuff

Lead time bias:  "Emphasis on early detection presumes earlier interventions are more effective," however, early detection might simply mean "living longer since time-of-diagnosis (by definition)" since some disease might run "its own course, at its own pace, regardless of intervention."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_time_bias

----------------------------


Telemedicine reimbursement -- 2015 in NY (there now exist billing codes, etc);  billing codes for apps and wearables is something new too......

Though there are legitimate reasons how mobile phones and wearables can help healthcare, many doctors are cautious -- and for good reason: false positives, inexperienced determination, misinterpretation, misinformed usage, etc.  In a sense, easily accessible biometric, health-related data is not a panacea for healthcare..........
