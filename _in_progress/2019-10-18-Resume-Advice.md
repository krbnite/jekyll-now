My advice for data scientists, machine learning engineers, and similar-buzzword-titles is this:
* If you have a general skills section, break it down into subsections, e.g.,
  - Languages
  - Analytics
  - Cloud
  - Databases
* For each subsection, then list the top-line ingredients, e.g., continuing our above example:
  - Language: Python, R, SQL
  - Analytics: Digital Signal Processing, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Visualization
  - Cloud: AWS, GCP
  - Databases: Postgres, MySQL, Redshift
* Then, for each top-line ingredient, use parentheses to expand upon it a bit, e.g.:
  - Language: Python (numpy, pandas, sklearn, keras, scipy, xgboost, etc), R (dplyr, tidyr, ggplot2, etc), SQL
  - Analytics: Digital Signal Processing (digital filtering, spectral analysis, wavelets, etc), Machine Learning (random forests, boosted trees, SVM, PCA, etc), Deep Learning (autoencoders, CNNs, RNNs, etc), Visualization (D3.js, ggplot2, Tableau)
  - Cloud: AWS (Redshift, S3, EC2), GCP (BigQuery)
  - Databases: Postgres, MySQL, Redshift
* Finally, in other parts of the resume where you lists jobs, you should list projects -- and for each project,
  you should parenthetically list a few of the skills used, followed by some bullet points about what you did
  - Data Scients @ Data Company
    * CoolProjectName1 (python, redshift, S3, keras, deep learning, CNNs, Tableau)
      - Designed python scripts to automatically query any new data landing in Redshift and identify 
        corresponding video files in S3
      - Built CNN model in keras and trained it to classify x/y/z in the video files
