One of my PhD advisors, Dr. Andrew Gerrard (Andy), would always warn against
working on what's popular.  It's inevitably a game of catching up, and trying
to stand out in a crowd of very homogeneous work.  For space weather related research,
the popular thing often closely tracked whatever NASA space mission was about to
initiate.  In data science circles these days, it's often something to do with
neural networks.

Andy's advice here would be to run.  

The reason is simple: the currently hot topic is almost certainly overblown, and if not,
there is almost certainly several research groups focused on the issue and any related issue, 
and so the funding is difficult to get...  More importantly, because of these hype clusters,
there is often a huge assortment of interesting problems ignored and unsolved...
