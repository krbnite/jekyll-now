# Avoid Playing Catch-Up
One of my PhD advisors, Dr. Andrew Gerrard (Andy), would always warn against
working on what's popular -- unless you just so happened to be the original, or in on 
the topic early enough.  It's inevitably a game of catching up, and trying
to stand out in a crowd of very homogeneous work.  For space weather related research,
the popular thing often closely tracked whatever NASA space mission related to the magnetosphere,
ionosphere, solar wind, or sun that was set to launch in the
next 2-3 years.  Makes sense, right?  That's where the funding is going to be -- in analyzing
the mission's data.  



# Skip the Funding Fight
The reason is simple: the currently hot topic is almost certainly overblown, and if not,
there is almost certainly several research groups focused on the issue and any related issue, 
and so the funding is difficult to get...  More importantly, because of these hype clusters,
there is often a huge assortment of interesting problems ignored and unsolved...


In data science circles these days, it's often something to do with
neural networks.

Andy's advice here would be to run.  



# Respect the Law of Limiting Originality
So the latest craze inspires you, and you think you have some great ideas!  Well, be honest
with yourself: how original are those ideas likely to be?  At least treat yourself to
a thorough Google search:  how many blog posts or StackExchange comments come dangerously close
to your idea?  Or on Google Scholar:  how many papers look like they basically cover your
idea?  The point is to be rigorously honest with yourself:  yes, you can work on your idea and
push the envelope further, but will it be an incremental push in a long succession of 
similar, incremental pushes?  Will your voice be heard in the raging sea of similar 
voices?  Not everyone will, can, or should be working on original or unpopular ideas, but
at least be honest with yourself about the expectations:  for example, at a conference, 
if your presentation  is yet another "popular craze" piece, expect general interest, but
some yawns, eye rolls, and stupid questions from people who are also excitedly trying to
keep up with the craze and (a) want to prove they know things too, or (b) want to prove that
you do not know things -- thus shouldn't be trying to hang with the cool kids. 

Point is, once you stop following the craze, the crowd and mentality will shift:  how many
times have you been at a conference of nearly everyone doing "popular craze" pieces, except
that one presentation you sat in on where the presenter talked about something completely
unrelated, but so damn insightful -- and rebellious!  That person stood out, right?  


# The Drone Risk
You might apply for a job that is interested in the "popular craze", and you might be 
asked to come present on something you've done that can showcase your skill set.  You bet your ass
that in the data science field, the "popular craze" thing is neural networks -- and your interviewer
wants to know that you are aware of it, and even particularly skilled at it, but also seriously wants
to throw out any potentially false positives!  If you come in and have 10 minutes to talk, and if
you choose to talk about the broadstrokes of a neural network project, you are going to sound like
a billion other candidates who came in and did the same.  

You're better off presenting on a linear regression you've done!  At the very least, this 
will wake up the interviewers and their pals in the room.  

Interviewer: (thinking): "Who is this ridiculously crazy,
rebel bad ass coming into my room and showing me a goddam linear regression!"

Others in room: (smirking, whispering)

Interviewer:  (aloud):  "Interesting.  Wonder why you chose to do it that way?"

YOU:  (aloud):  ...excellent explanation about how this worked nearly as well as other methods, is highly interpretable, was easy to explain to the marketing team and help deploy with the engineering team, and helped increase revenue streams, 
etc, etc... (all the stuff your interviewers truly care about on a day-to-day level)

Interview's Crony:  (aloud):  "Surely, a hidden layer or two would have made this better."

You:  ...chance to show that you are fully aware of neural networks, hidden layers, activation functions, and whatever...

Interviews:  (aloud):  All good points.
