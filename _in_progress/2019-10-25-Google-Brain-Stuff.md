I was reading a post from ReWork about a talk Hugo Larochelle gave at a recent event: "For training using 
supervised accuracy, Google Brain uses prototypical networks and for unsupervised they use certoi networks."

So I wanted to dedicate this blog to learning about and discussing:
* prototypical networks
* certoi networks
