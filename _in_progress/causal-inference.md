From [intro](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/crash-course-in-causality/confusion-over-causality-x4UMR):
  - The goals of causal modeling:
    * formal definitions of causal effects
    * assumptions necessary to identify causal effects from data
    * rules about what (confounding) variables need to be controlled for
    * sensitivity analyses to determine the impact of violations of assumptions on conclusions
    
 Wright [1921] and Neyman [1923] were early pioneers of causal modeling, though the field did not
 full mature until the 1970s with Rubin's causal model (Rubin [1974]). In the 1980s, Greenland and Robins [1986]
 introduced causal diagrams, Rosenbaum and Rubin [1983] introduced propensity scores, and Robins [1986] introduced
 time-dependent confounding (followed up in Robins [1997]).  Then there  the later work on causal diagrams by 
 Pearl [2000] (side note: Pearl is from NJIT!).  Post-2000, there are the methods of optimal dynamic treatment
 strategies (Murphy [2003]; Robins [2004]) and a machine learning approach called targeted learning (van der Laan [2009]).
 
 These methods are primarily for observational studies and natural experiments -- things as they are in the world.  The ideal
 is to use randomized control... But you just cannot do that for many things (think weather, astronomy, disease, etc).
