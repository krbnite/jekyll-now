I was going to put this one paper in my random forest reference list, but after reading half the paper and skimming the
rest I don't think that's the right place for it.  It was a general ensemble paper, not specific to random forests,
but focused on bagging anything -- and not just ol' fashioned bagging.  It mentions several other types of bagging;
things I've never even heard of... That's when I realized I should probably learn more about ensemble methods
in general -- thus this new reference list.
