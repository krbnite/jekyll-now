> I ain't afraid of hard work, and I'll out-work every mothafucka that there is to get where I wanna go.
~ Stone Cold Steve Austin

> STOPPING IMPROVEMENT is death. There is no goal. There is no final destination. There is only direction.
~ James Altucher

> A human being is a part of the whole called by us human beings, 'the universe'; a part limited in time and 
> space. We experience ourselves, our thoughts and feelings as something separate from the rest---a kind of optical 
> delusion of consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to 
> affection for a few persons nearest to us.
~ Albert Einstein


> So live your life that the fear of death can never enter your heart. Trouble no one about their religion; respect others in their 
> view, and demand that they respect yours. Love your life, perfect your life, beautify all things in your life. Seek to make your 
> life long and its purpose in the service of your people. Prepare a noble death song for the day when you go over the great 
> divide. Always give a word or a sign of salute when meeting or passing a friend, even a stranger, when in a lonely place. Show 
> respect to all people and grovel to none. When you arise in the morning give thanks for the food and for the joy of living. If you 
> see no reason for giving thanks, the fault lies only in yourself. Abuse no one and no thing, for abuse turns the wise ones to fools 
> and robs the spirit of its vision. When it comes your time to die, be not like those whose hearts are filled with the fear of death, 
> so that when their time comes they weep and pray for a little more time to live their lives over again in a different way. Sing your 
> death song and die like a hero going home.
~ Chief Tecumseh (Crouching Tiger)

> Differential forms are taking over the world. I don't use vectors, Fortran, or Roman numerals, all for the same reasons.
~ William L. Burke (author of Applied Differential Geometry)

> Expensive vitamin pills and wheat germ on your windowsill;
> Schedule's hectic and you got no time to kill.
> Earning money and youâ€™re spending it the right way
> Just in such a rush - You don't know if it's night or day
> 
> 5:30 get up, run run run - then you work eight hours slaving under the gun
> Your little world's based on lies, lies, lies - always rushing but you're never ever satisfied!

> Healthy body sick mind - Working overtime
> Healthy body sick mind - Too hectic, too hectic
> Healthy body sick mind - Why dont you justify
> It's just a matter of time: Sick body sick mind
~ Operation Ivy, "Healthy Body, Sick Mind"

> One of the secrets of a long and fruitful life is to forgive everybody everything everynight before you go to bed.
~ Bernard Baruch


> Publish your idea along with the objections to it. ... Publish the two contradictory ideas along with their consequences

~ Gellman

> A good many times I have been present at gatherings of people who, by the standards of the traditional culture, are thought highly educated and who have with considerable gusto been expressing their incredulity at the illiteracy of scientists. Once or twice I have been provoked and have asked the company how many of them could describe the Second Law of Thermodynamics. The response was cold: it was also negative. Yet I was asking something which is about the scientific equivalent of: Have you read a work of Shakespeare's? 
>
> I now believe that if I had asked an even simpler question -- such as, What do you mean by mass, or acceleration, which is the scientific equivalent of saying, Can you read? -- not more than one in ten of the highly educated would have felt that I was speaking the same language. So the great edifice of modern physics goes up, and the majority of the cleverest people in the western world have about as much insight into it as their neolithic ancestors would have had.
~ C. P. Snow

> Forgiveness releases you from the drain of holding a grudge and sets you free to love and laugh again. It takes less energy to forgive than to resent.
~ Ed & Deb Shapiro
